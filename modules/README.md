# Modules

Here you will find all the modules available for the server.  
Some are fully done and others are in develop, please check the *README.md* of the module before you try to build it, it might not be implemented in the server yet.

***

Each module has a *readme* witch contains:   

***The name of the module***  
***A very brief overlook at the module complexity***
- Difficulty
- Economic cost
- Dependencies
- Integration

***A description of the  project***  
Including what it does, difficulty and cost of the project  

***A list of materials and tools***  
Like components, consumables, tools and all you will need to finish the module.  
A PC is almost always required, so sometimes is omitted.

If there is some electronics involved, a schematics diagram will be provided.

<!-- ***A video about the project***  
About how to build the module and a step by step explanation of each part of the module -->

# FAQ
***Why some of the modules have more than one version if git is used?***  
the software is easily updated, but the hardware is not, having the schematics and it's firmware around is a good idea if you are having trouble with an older version module.
